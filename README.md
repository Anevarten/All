The purpose of this project is to determine the wait time for a fast food restaurant using image processing. This project employs transfer learning from a YOLOv3 model
to determine the number of people standing in queue and the national average wait times for each person for a fast-food chain to determine how long it'll take for
a new person entering the queue to get their food.
